Lyon Exploration todos:

* [ ] Make a drawn shape move (i.e. implement a system that accesses a shape's Transform, which is added in the setup systems)

* [ ] Make a path move, similar to above

* [ ] Implement grid scaling in an app that includes lyon shapes/paths (maybe combine with snake redux example below)

* [ ] Recreate snake example with shapes (think translucent circles, etc =) instead of just plain sprite blocks

* [ ] Create a multi-purpose "template" or packaged system or whatever that provides grid-based scaling whenever I need it.
    * What would the features of such a thing be? (might need to work on the item before this first to get some ideas)
